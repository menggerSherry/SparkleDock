# SparkleDock: A GPU-Native Flexible Macromolecule Docking System

# Overview

SparkleDock is a GPU-native GSO docking system, enabling large-scale flexible macromolecule docking. It supports:

*  A fine-grained, glowworm-level parallelization to match the SM in GPU.
*  TensorCore accelerated CUDA kernel design to enhance the computing efficiency.
*  Efficient MPI design to adaptively scale across multi-GPU systems.

SparkleDock can accelerate the macromolecule docking by over two orders of magnitude compared to the existing flexible macromolecule docking.
